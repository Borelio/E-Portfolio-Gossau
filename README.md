This project was developed for module 150 in school. The aim of the project was to demonstrate our ability to integrate multimedia content into a website.

## Features 🚀

- Integrated Game: The website includes a multiplayer game where visitors can drive cars from the logo around the site. The game starts by pressing the W or S key and the car can be controlled using the WASD keys. There is also a small boost feature that can be activated by pressing the space bar.

## Technologies Used 💻

- Angular: Used for the frontend development
- Node.js: Used for the backend development

## Installation 🛠️

There are two installation options available:

### Option 1: Frontend Only
1. Clone the repository.
1. Navigate to the Frontend directory.
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `ng serve` to start the frontend application.
1. Open http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser.

Please note that without the backend, the game will not function. However, all other features will work as intended.

### Option 2: Frontend and Backend
1. Follow the steps from option 1.
1. Navigate to the Server directory.
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `node src/index.js` to start the backend server.
1. Open http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser.

With the backend running, the game and all other features will work as intended.
